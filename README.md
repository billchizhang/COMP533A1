# COMP533A1 Task 3 Reusable Logging Module 

2 aspects in use, one is for the generic aspect, the other is a case-specific aspect
The generic aspect, LoggingAspect, must be included in the src folder in order to use the generic logging module 
The user shall write a case-specific aspect with the model class and have it extended the LoggingAspect and override the abstract methods, i.e logBefore and logAfter with desired logging msg and update the pointcuts (pointsToBeLoggedAtfer and pointsToBeLoggedBefore) to intercept specifc points in the program.
